Privacy Policy for Enhanced Website Safety Checker
Effective Date: 17-10-2024
Introduction
Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains what data is collected by the Enhanced Website Safety Checker extension and how it is used to ensure your safety while browsing.
Data Collection
Our extension collects certain types of data to perform its primary function of website safety checks. The data we collect includes:
•	Location Data (IP address): Used solely for determining the region of websites being accessed to check their safety. This data is not stored or shared.
•	Web History (URLs of visited sites): The extension temporarily analyzes the URLs of websites you visit to check for potential threats like phishing or malicious sites. This data is not stored or shared after the safety check is completed.
•	Website Content (text, images, and other data on websites): Analyzed in real-time to detect threats. This data is used only for the duration of the check and is not stored.
We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information, health information, or financial information.
Data Usage
The collected data is used solely to:
•	Check websites for potential threats (such as phishing, malware, and explicit content).
•	Analyze and verify the security of websites, including checks for SSL certificates, domain age, and other safety indicators.
None of the data collected is shared with third parties, except for external services used to verify website safety (such as Google Safe Browsing, WHOIS API), and no personally identifiable data is sent.
Data Retention
We do not retain any user data beyond what is necessary for real-time checks. Once the website check is complete, all data associated with that check is discarded immediately.
Third-Party Services
To enhance security checks, our extension uses third-party APIs, including:
•	Google Safe Browsing: For identifying dangerous sites.
•	WHOIS XML API: For checking domain information.
These services are used solely for checking website authenticity and security. We do not share any personally identifiable information with these services.
User Rights
As a user, you have the right to:
•	Understand what data we collect and how it is used.
•	Contact us for any concerns about data privacy.
Changes to the Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with a new effective date at the top of this policy.
